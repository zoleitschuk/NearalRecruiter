1.	About Job Hunter:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Job Hunter is an application designed to help individuals streamline
their job search. The application takes a set of job descriptions that a
user has rated on a scale of 1-5 for two different categories:

	i.	how interesting they feel the job described is, and
	ii.	how well they meet the requirements for the job itself.

The job descriptions and both of their ratings are then used to
train a machine learning algorithm. Once the algorithm is trained, the
program is then able to automatically rate jobs for both categories
without user input. The application then generates a scatter plot of the
results. Each dot represents a job description. Dots that are higher on
the y-axis represents jobs that the user would likely find more interesting
or fulfilling than dots that are located lower on the y-axis. Likewise,
dots that are further right on the x-axis are ones that the user would
likely be more qualified to perform than those that are located further to
the left on the x-axis. Therefore, users not only save time by not having
to read through hundreds of job descriptions, but can focus their
efforts on “high success” jobs by selecting jobs in the top right portion
of the chart. These jobs represent "high success" jobs where the user is
passionate about the activities involved with the job, and qualified to
perform those activities.

Additionally, each dot is also colored according to what company the job
description belongs to. This coloring allows a user to visually identify
certain companies that would be better make a better/worse fit over others.

For example: say that the majority of dots for a particular company are
very low on the y-axis. This company is likely not the best fit for that
individual as the bulk of the work that that company is looking to perform
does not appear interesting or fulfilling to that individual. WARNING: this
type of analysis is only valid if the job description library has an
accurate representation of jobs at that company, and the machine learning
algorithm is trained properly.

Motivation behind this App:
I originally wrote this application to help me with my own job search,
and to serve as a portfolio project to aid in landing my dream job once
I found it. I found while I was able to identify positions easily
using manual means, that purely manual methods had some significant
downsides:
	a.	Job Search Depression - after hours of sifting through job
		descriptions (most of which were not a good fit) I would feel
		completely uninspired by the prospect of ever finding a dream job.
	b.	Wasted Time - I was spending hours reading job descriptions that 
		were not valid prospects.
	c.	No Overall Context - Even after isolating a set of jobs that I was
		interested in and qualified for, there was no overarching context
		to how that position fit into the company. In order to get this
		more reading and research was required. Meaning most likely more
		wasted time, and likely more dead ends.

As a result, I decided the best way to avoid these downsides was to write a
computer program to speed up the process, and visually display the results
for interpretation. The final result is this application. I hope you find
it useful as well.

2.	Setting Up your Computer to Run Job Hunter:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following section provides a description of the requirements to run
Job Hunter on your computer as well as a step by step guide on setting
up Job Hunter to run.

Requirements:
1.	GNU Octave
2.	JSONlab
3.	Python 3
4.	pandas *^
5.	numpy *^
6.	sqlalchemy *^
7.	bokeh *^
8.	beautifulsoup4 *^
9.	oct2py *

* python libraries
^ python libraries included in installation of Anaconda (see Set-up 2.)

Set-up:
1.	Copy the entire Job Hunter folder including files and sub-folders to
	any location on your computer with read and write permissions.
	
2.	Download and install GNU Octave. You can download GNU Octave from:
	https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html
	To install simply follow the installation wizard.
	
3.	Download JSONlab from:
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files
	and add folder (make sure to unzip) into Octave's search path.
	The lazy way to do this is by moving the entire downloaded folder
	into a directory that is already part of Octave's path. On my 
	machine this directory is:
	C:\Octave\Octave-4.0.3\share\octave\4.0.3\m
	To see what directories are part of Octave's search path on your machine,
	simply run Octave, and run the command: path
	This will print out all directories that are part of Octave's search
	path on your machine.
	
3.	Download and install python 3. Any version of python 3 should work
	fine; however, you may need to install all of the required python
	libraries. To avoid this extra work, I recommend installing Anaconda.
	You can download Anaconda from:
	https://www.continuum.io/downloads
	After downloading simply follow the installation wizard to install.
	
4.	Install the required python libraries. If you installed python
	through Anaconda you will only need to install oct2py. To install
	oct2py follow the instructions here:
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oct2py
	
5.	Add GNU Octave to your path. For information on how to do this go
	here:
	http://blink1073.github.io/oct2py/source/installation.html
	and follow the instructions under "GNU Octave Installation". This
	step is necessary in order for oct2py to function correctly.
	
6. Set-up complete.

					Adding New Jobs to the Library:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
	Users are able to add new jobs to the library by selecting the
	appropriate action and then referencing the absolute location of a
	file (Input File) containing job descriptions.
	
	The program expects that the Input File contains 1 self contained
	block of html for each job posting. Input Files can contain multiple
	job postings. For examples of Input Files please see the files in:
	\Job Hunter\data\input_data\archive
	
	Note:	The process of loading new jobs into the job library is time 
			intensive. It takes roughly 15-60 sec to load each job into
			the job library. There will be NO feedback from the program
			as it loading files into the job library. Once loading is
			complete, the program will return you to the main menu.
			
	Special Companies:	There are a "few special" companies that the
						program will automatically get additional data
						from the job description. This data includes
						the job title, job reference number, the job
						location, and the job posting date. When the user
						enters a company name the program will check to see
						if the company name entered matches one of the
						"Special Companies". If it does, then the program
						will run an extra function to get the extra data
						from the job description.
	
	WARNING:	If a user inputs a company name that matches one of the
				"Special Companies" the program WILL CRASH if the html of
				the job description does not match what is expected by the
				program. To avoid this only input the name of a "Special 
				Company" if the job descriptions inside the file were taken
				from the locations outlined below:
				
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|Special Company Name:	|	Special Company Job Description html Source:								|
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|	Apple				|	jobs.apple.com/us/search?													|
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|	Intuitive Surgical	|	intuitive.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobsearch.ftl?lang=en					|

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Note:	I add Special Companies on an as needed basis; however, feel free
			to add your own Special Companies. The code for managing Special
			Companies is located here:
			\Job Hunter\python_scripts\job_data.py

							Rating Jobs:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
	When you perform this action the program will ask you how many job
	descriptions you would like to rate. After you enter a number it
	will display one of the job descriptions from the job library, and
	request a rating from 1-5 for both how interesting you find the job,
	and how qualified you feel you are to perform the job. Guidance on
	each rating is as follows:
	
Interest
	1	-	A score of 1 on interest represents a job that you would:
				i.	very likely leave without any backup plans.
			
	2	-	A score of 2 on interest represents a job that you would:
				i.	leave as soon as anything slightly better presented
					itself
				ii. recognize this job as a way to pay bills
			
	3	-	A score of 3 on interest represents a job that you would:
				i.	accept and stay in in order to build experience
				ii. recognize that there is up to 2 years of valuable
					experience
				
	4	-	A score of 4 on interest represents a job that you would:
				i.	almost call a dream job
				ii.	easily see yourself fulfilled for 2-5 years
				
	5	-	A score of 5 on interest represents a job that you would:
				i.	call a dream job
				ii.	easily see yourself fulfilled for 5+ years
	
Qualifications
	1	-	A score of 1 on qualifications represents a job that you:
				i.	do not have any idea what the job description
					refers to.
				ii.	honestly would not be successful in this position
				
	2	-	A score of 2 on qualifications represents a job that you:
				i.	feel you need a 2+ years of full time education/training
					in order to rank the position as a 3
				ii.	honestly would not be successful in this position
				
	3	-	A score of 3 on qualifications represents a job that you:
				i.	you meet the educational requirements for, but lack 
					a large portion of domain specific knowledge
				ii.	feel that you would require significant support in
					getting up to speed in this role
				iii.have the base skills needed for this role.
				
	4	-	A score of 4 on qualifications represents a job that you:
				i.	you have a large portion of the qualifications
					required for this role either as direct experience,
					or as a tangential transferable skill
				ii.	feel that you would require a moderate to minimal
					amount of support and guidance to get up to speed
					in this role
				
	5	-	A score of 5 on qualifications represents a job that you:
				i.	the role outlined in this description is one that you have
					performed in the past, or you have had experience in
					all areas outlined in the description.
				ii.	you would excel in this position with almost no guidance

			Making Predictions on Jobs that Have not been Rated:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
	In order to make predictions on un-rated job descriptions, you must
	train the neural network. After training is completed, the program
	will make a prediction for every job description in the library, and
	save those predictions to the database.
	
	Note: 	I recommend having 100+ rated job descriptions in order for
			the results to be accurate. The more jobs you have rated, the
			more accurate your results will be.
	
	Note:	You only need to run the training step if you have: a. added
			more new jobs to the library, or b. performed new ratings that
			you would like to have taken into account when the program
			makes predictions on jobs within the library.
			
	Note:	The training and prediction step takes 10-20 minutes. During
			this time the program will not give you any feedback. Once it
			is finished it will return you to the main menu.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
						Resetting User Ratings:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
	By using this function you will reset all ratings that have been made
	on jobs within the job library.
	
	WARNING:	This action is not reversible. If you preform this action
				All user input ratings will be removed.
				
	Note:	You will likely want to perform this action before making your
			own ratings. I have saved my own preferences with the base
			library for demo purposes.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
							Viewing the Results:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
	Upon performing this action, the program should open your internet
	browser and display a chart with your results. The most recent version
	of this chart is also automatically saved in the root directory of the
	Job Hunter application as "job_hunt_scatter.html".

4.	Potential Improvements to Job Hunter:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a ton of improvements I would like to eventually make to this
application. In broad strokes here are a few of the changes I would like
to make in the future:

1.	Upgrade UI.
2.	Run application from the Web.
3.	Scrape job descriptions automatically from the web.
4.	Provide more analysis on companies, jobs, individual career
	progression, and user preferences.
5.	Add more advanced machine learning algorithms, and upgrade the
	current neural network.

=========================================================================
5.	Credits:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the Stanford's Machine Learning
course on Coursera available here:
(https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
I completed this course and was immediately able to begin applying its
content to solving problems. In fact, the machine learning algorithm
used in this application is a modification of two of the assignments that
were required material for completion if the course. If you have an
interest in learning about machine learning, I highly recommend this
course.
